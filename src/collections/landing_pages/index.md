        text: "\"This is my 2nd set of Emsculpt. I can definitely tell a difference from my treatments and would highly recommend it for anyone else not wanting to go under the knife. A great addition to your regular exercise routine! Glutes: 1/10 on the intensity scale (at 100% power). Honestly, it's actually comfortable and enjoyable for me. Abs: 5/10 on the intensity scale (at 100% power). And it's true when they tell you that you’ll crave the treatments.\""

        text: "\"I’m a 38-yr. old mom. I’ve reached my goal weight of 123 lbs. at 5’5, but due to having children and honestly always having a soft loose belly, I still was unhappy with how my stomach looked. The Emsculpt is mostly to build muscle and is not the same as cool sculpting. The procedure itself is only 30 mins long and not painful at all. I’ve had 2 of the 4 treatments and feel like I already see a slight difference and definitely already feel that my core is stronger. I can’t wait to see how it looks in 4 weeks from now when I should see the full results!\""

        text: "\"I am a mom of two, after giving birth naturally and a c section I had a lack of strength in my abs. Emsculpt was the answer!! 7 months after having a baby I had ab strength like never before and it improves with time. I work out 3-4 days a week and this really improved my ab workout. I’m so thankful for this treatment; it made me feel strong again. I’ve had pelvic pain since my first birth, and it went away after I strengthened my core. I can do more squats and feel the strength when I’m exercising. Emsculpt is definitely worth a try.\""

        text: "\"I had Emsculpt on my glutes and thighs. It helped me build muscle in two regions that I struggle with building muscle and it tone/lifted my glute. I got AMAZING results with Emsculpt. It was easy and completely non-invasive treatment, without breaking a sweat.\""

        text: "\"I had Emsculpt done on my arms and I’m very pleased with it and my shirts are looser now around the arms area. I would do the treatment again with no question asked! My arms look great! It’s painless.\""

        text: "\"Loved my experience with Dr. Beausoliel and her staff!! She is so attentive and provided ample time for questions. I had Sculpture done and she stayed with me the entire time. It is a very relaxing environment. Highly recommend Dr. Beausoleil!!! \""

        text: "\"I can't believe a place like this is finally here. I had my consultation today. The staff is great, such a wonderful, friendly and informative experience. Brand new state of the art equipment to muscle build and maintain a tight firm body. This is exactly what I have been looking for, for a long time. Since my auto accident I have not been able to attend any gym and due to an injury I also can't lift anything anymore I'm excited to get started on this journey shaping and tightening this body to perfection.\""

        text: "\"I started my arm SculpSure series last week, after my first treatment, I put on a shirt that normally fits snug around my arms and now the shirt finally fits comfortably! It actually worked! I am very pleased with the treatment and service I received from Get Tight Spa and I will definitely come back for more treatments in the near future.\""
