    Graduated from Swedish Institute College of Health Sciences in 2016, as a AMT registered Clinical & Administrative Medical Assistant with an Associates of Occupational Studies. Experience in many specialties such as, Urology, Gynecology, Neurology, Orthopedics, Infertility, Rheumatology, Bariatric and Plastic Surgery. My personal goal is to help you achieve maximum results and guide you through your journey for your new and improved look. I started out my weight loss journey in 2017 at 322lbs. I decided to do something about it because I was unhappy with my appearance and the way I felt. To date, I have lost 181lbs with Bariatric surgery, diet, and exercise. Now I am excited to start a new journey with each and every one of you by sharing my story and help guide yours. You only get one body to enjoy and I strongly believe that here at Get Tight Spa, We can guide you on the right track to a better, healthier and stronger YOU!
