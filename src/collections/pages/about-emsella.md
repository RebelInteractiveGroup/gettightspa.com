      ## Trust the Science. Love the Results.

      Urinary incontinence is an embarrassing condition that affects millions of adult men and women. Emsella® is a revolutionary new system that harnesses the power of electromagnetic energy to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles. Emsella can help with all types of urinary incontinence — stress, urge, and mixed — and may also improve sexual function.

      #### What is Emsella? 

      Emsella is a revolutionary treatment that uses high-intensity focused electromagnetic (HIFEM) technology to improve urinary incontinence. Emsella stimulates muscle contractions in the pelvic floor and surrounding tissues to promote strength in the muscles that control the bladder and urinary system. 


      During a single treatment at Get Tight Spa, Emsella delivers around 11,200 contractions, which is equivalent to doing the exact same number of Kegel exercises. It would be difficult for you to do that many Kegels on your own, and many patients have difficulty isolating the necessary muscles to do Kegel exercises correctly. Emsella offers an extra intense workout for the muscles responsible for urinary control.

      &nbsp;

      #### What should I expect during an Emsella treatment? 


      When you have an Emsella treatment at Get Tight Spa, you don’t even need to get undressed. The Emsella system is a chair that you sit on comfortably, fully clothed. Each treatment is 28 minutes long. 


      The chair delivers HIFEM waves through the seat; during your session, the electromagnetic energy penetrates deep into the structures of your pelvic floor to deliver thousands of contractions that improve muscle tone and increase urinary control. 


      You’ll feel your pelvic floor muscles contracting, and you may experience some tingling during your session. There’s no downtime following treatment so you can return to daily activities right away.

      #### When will I experience the results of Emsella? 


      You may notice an improvement shortly after your first Emsella treatment, and you’ll continue to see a gradual improvement over the next week or two after each appointment. In most cases, a series of six sessions is necessary for optimal results. Most of the time, two treatments are scheduled each week for three weeks.
