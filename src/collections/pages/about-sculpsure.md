      #### What is body contouring with SculpSure? 

      SculpSure is an innovative laser system that offers permanent, targeted fat reduction in problem areas. SculpSure uses concentrated laser energy to destroy fat deposits beneath the surface of your skin, without harming your skin and surrounding tissues. 


      SculpSure treatments deliver focused heat to fat cells until they become damaged. Your body’s natural immune process then gradually eliminates the damaged cells over time, resulting in enhanced definition for a more contoured silhouette.

      #### How many SculpSure treatments will I need? 


      When you have your initial consultation at Get Tight Spa, your specialist creates a personalized treatment plan based on your body composition, your personal goals for fat reduction, and other individual factors. Most of the time, a series of two sessions, four weeks apart is needed to achieve optimal results. 
      
      
      It’s important to understand that SculpSure isn’t a weight loss treatment, and is best suited for people whose BMI is 30 or less.

      #### What should I expect during a SculpSure treatment? 
      
      
      SculpSure body sculpting treatments typically take about 30 minutes per treatment area. During your session, you relax in a comfortable position, and the laser applicators are attached to the treatment area. You will feel cycles of warmth and coolness. Some people describe tingling or mild cramping during the heating cycle, but nothing intolerable. The intensity of the laser can be adjusted during treatment. 
      
      
      After your session, you may have some local tenderness or a small lump below the skin, but this should fade over the next few days. Gentle massages to the treatment area is encouraged to improve lymphatic flow to help remove the dead fat cells.

      #### When can I expect to see results after SculpSure treatment? 

      With laser body contouring by SculpSure, your results will appear very natural because your body eliminates targeted fat cells over a period of several weeks. Initial results should start to become visible about six weeks after your first treatment. After 12 weeks, you can enjoy the boost of confidence that comes from seeing your impressive new shape and curves. 
      
      
      The fat cells targeted by SculpSure have been permanently removed; however, you’ll need to remain at a stable weight to maintain your results because remaining fat cells can plump up without proper nutrition and plenty of exercise.
