      ## Trust the Science. Love the Results.

      If you have stubborn areas that aren’t as toned or defined as you’d like, Emsculpt® is a cutting-edge treatment that is both a functional and aesthetic solution. Emsculpt doesn’t just remove fat; it builds muscle, for a sleeker, stronger, and more defined silhouette.

      #### What is Emsculpt? 

      Emsculpt is a revolutionary body sculpting system that uses high-intensity focused electromagnetic (HIFEM®) technology to reduce unwanted fat and build muscle tissue in problem areas. Emsculpt uses HIFEM waves to stimulate roughly 20,000 involuntary muscle contractions in the target area. These intense muscle contractions cause your body to release free fatty acids, which contribute to the breakdown of stubborn fat. The contractions are like an extra-vigorous workout, so they also help build muscle in the treatment area.

      #### Which areas can Emsculpt treat? 


      Emsculpt is FDA-cleared to tone and build muscle in problem areas, such as: 
      
      
      * Abdomen

      * Arms - Biceps / Triceps

      * Buttocks

      * Thighs

      * Calves


      Emsculpt’s innovative technology offers the first noninvasive option for a “butt-lift.”

      #### What should I expect during an Emsculpt treatment? 


      An Emsculpt treatment takes about 30 minutes, during which you can lie back and relax. Your Get Tight Spa aesthetics specialist attaches the Emsculpt applicators to the target area and begins the treatment with gentler contractions, which gradually increase in intensity throughout your session. 


      You’ll feel your muscles tightening, and you might feel some tingling, but no pain. Your practitioner can adjust the intensity throughout the session.

      #### When will I see results? 
      
      
      You should notice some improvement in the treated area right after your Emsculpt session. Typically, four Emsculpt treatments scheduled 2-5 days apart are needed for optimal results, with maximum results becoming visible 4-8 weeks after your final session.
